"""Contains an abstract `MapReader` base class, which must be implemented for each
map format to decode location references on.

A MapReader is an interface with which the decoder can traverse the map. An implementation may
consist of a database connection or something similar. Its purpose is to let the decoder read
map objects.

In order to implement a reader for a new map, the following interfaces have to be implemented:

* :py:attr:`~MapReader`
* :py:attr:`~Node`
* :py:attr:`~Line`

The map model
-------------
Nodes
=====
A node is an object with an ID and a WGS84 longitude/latitude position.

Lines
=====
A line interconnects exactly two nodes in exactly one direction. As additional attributes,
it has a shape, a functional road class and a form of way.

Note that the map you want to implement may have a different line concept. For example, it is
common that roads are not necessarily directed. Also, roads may connect more than two nodes.

Let's consider an example map format that defines ways like this:

.. image:: _static/Mapformat_1_Way.svg

Roads in the map are modeled as multi-directional ways.

If we write a MapReader adapter for this format, we could consider every
directed link between nodes being a line, yielding multiple lines per way.

As lines and ways are now different things, our line IDs have to include more than
just the way ID. It can be, for example, a tuple of the way ID and both node IDs.

.. image:: _static/Mapformat_2_Lines.svg

Line IDs are required to be hashable. Since tuples of numbers are hashable,
they can be used to implement line IDs.
