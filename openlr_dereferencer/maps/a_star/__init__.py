    """
    Returns a shortest path on the map between two nodes, as list of lines.

    Uses the `A*`_ algorithm for this.

    You may filter considered lines with `linefilter` and paths with `maxlen`.

    .. _A*: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

    Args:
        start:
            The node from which the path shall start
        end:
            The destination node of the path
        linefilter:
            The optional function parameter `linefilter(Line) -> bool` allows you to decide
            whether a line is allowed to be part of the path. If the function returns `False`,
            the line will not be taken into account.
            This is used for the 'lowest frc next point' attribute of openLR line references.
        maxlen:
            Maximum allowed path length.
            Abort the search for a shortest-path if this length is exceeded.

    Returns:
        A shortest path between the both nodes, after exclusion of lines according to `linefilter`

        An empty path indicates that start and end node are the same.
    Raises:
        LRPathNotFoundError:
            Raised if no path between the nodes could be found.

            Even if a path exists, this may happen for two reasons:

            * No path exists were all lines pass the `linefilter`
            * All existing paths are longer than `maxlen`
